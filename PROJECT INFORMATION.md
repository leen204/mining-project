Project Motivation:
Alzheimer’s Disease poses significant challenges not only to individuals but also to their families. For example, the emotional toll of a daughter being unrecognized by her mother or a granddaughter by her grandmother is a reality many face. This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the disease by identifying key risk factors and developing predictive models. The goal is to enhance early detection, allowing for better care and support, ultimately improving the lives of both patients and their families.

Project Introduction: 
This project explores a dataset of 2,149 patients with comprehensive health information related to Alzheimer’s Disease. The data includes details such as demographics, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive assessments, and symptoms
